## Learn C++: A Deep Dive Beyond the Classroom

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan, and while C++ is part of the curriculum, I’m committed to building a deeper, more hands-on understanding of the language beyond what’s taught in class.

This repository documents my personal journey through [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com), where I dedicate at least 30 minutes each day to learning and practicing modern C++. Each chapter is paired with self-built mini projects or code samples that apply the concepts in a practical way.

Every step of the process—from code experiments to reflections—is organized and clearly documented to track my growth and demonstrate real-world application of C++ fundamentals and advanced features.
