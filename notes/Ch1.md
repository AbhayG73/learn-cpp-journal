# Chapter 02 â€“ Functions and Files

## âœ… What I Learned
- Declaring and initializing variables in C++
- Basic data types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`)
- Using `std::cout` and `std::cin`
- Importance of `#include <iostream>`

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
- All variables must be declared with a type
- `std::endl` flushes the output buffer (slower than `\n`)

## ðŸ§ª Practice Code
See [../snippets/variables_and_types.cpp](../snippets/variables_and_types.cpp)

## ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
- Why use `std::endl` over `\n`?
- How are uninitialized variables treated?

## ðŸ“Œ Reflection
Felt pretty comfortable with the basics. Tomorrow Iâ€™ll review control structures.
